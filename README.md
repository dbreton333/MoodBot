# MoodBot
## Description
MoodBot is my final project for the data science Lighthouse Labs bootcamp. It is a attention recognition program that can track a face and eyes from a webcam and can
output if the person in front of the webcam is paying attention or not. To do so I check wether the person is looking at its screen and if his eyes are opened.
